            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Web development involves working on technical aspects of websites.
                In other words, web developers are programmers who specialize in the development of web applications and interfaces. Many web developers also double as web designers, which means they don't only bring websites to life, but also build the architecture, including visual design and layouts – however, if web design isn't something you're interested in, you don't have to offer these services.
